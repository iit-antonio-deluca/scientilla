*** DIGITAL CERTIFICATE

For your convenience the Scientilla GitHub repository, as well as any Scientilla installation packages released by the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, includes a self-signed digital certificate so that you are not required to generate one by yourself.

This is fine until you interact with the software only from this machine and to manage personal data.

Remember that you should obtain and configure a real certificate, or maybe another self-signed certificate, in case you want to interact with the software from another machine or to manage data of other people.

For more information about digital certificates please read the following guide:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate

ATTENTION: we suggest you to ask for help to a specialist in case you don't know what to do.

The certificate files reside into the {installation path}/certs/ folder.

If you want to put your certificate files into another folder please use the "Settings" panel of the software to set the correct paths. You can also manually change the paths by opening the {installation path}/server/configuration/installation.json file with a text editor.
