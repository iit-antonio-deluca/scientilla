#####*The first Independent Scientific Register for Organizations and Researchers*

SCIENTILLA is: a free network for exchanging bibliographic metadata and a software in order to access to this network.

The network is designed for organizations and researchers to manage, share and promote metadata relating to their scientific publications. Data can be completely shared by all the members of the network and they will always be open.

Organizations and researchers can then work together helping to improve the quality and the accuracy of the bibliographic metadata.

The software is open source, editable and extensible.

The main functionalities can be summarized in four points:
* Organization of publications found on your installation
* Sharing of publications found on your installation
* Aggregation of publications in other remote installations
* Integration of publications available on other web resources

**Organization** 

The system allows users to enter metadata regarding their scientific publications (references) that are stored locally.
The references can be checked, corrected and "signed" by the authors and the institutions that produced them.

**Sharing** 

The system allows users to choose the references to share with the SCIENTILLA community and sign them with users' profile.
Each installation (peer) can thus view the data of all the others.
Through this mechanism, based on a peer-to-peer architecture, users can work together to clean and refine data and identify their "fatherhood".
The Profile is the set of information that unequivocally identifies the user on SCIENTILLA.

**Aggregation**

The system allows each installation to collect and process the data shared with/by the other installations in order to extract information on the following:
* how many versions there are of the same reference and easily figure out the most trusted by the other users
* the list of researchers authors of publications in the network
* the list of organizations involved in publications in the network
* the list of publications related to a researcher profile on SCIENTILLA
* the list of publications related to an organization profile on SCIENTILLA
* the list of publications related to an URL or IP address from which they were pick up (source installation)

**Integration**

The system allows you to configure the interface with other data resources that share information about scientific production metadata in order to allow the user to search for references and import them.
In this way you can quickly define and complete your references list.



## IMPORTANT

SCIENTILLA is in Alpha phase. While we are writing documentation to help people using it, as well as contributing to the development, it is at moment recommended only for a technical audience.



## Using SCIENTILLA

Scientilla is a web application that works also from your desktop and that is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux. You can download the installation package and run it from your hardware and networking facilities or request a demo on [http://www.scientilla.net](http://www.scientilla.net) so that you can check what the software does.


##Extending SCIENTILLA##

The development of Scientilla continues constantly and collaborations are really wanted and accepted.
